## Supported technologies

### .NET 7 and .NET Framework 4.8.1

.NET 4.8.1 has been [released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-framework-481/) earlier this month, while .NET 7 should land in autumn this year. Now you can use BenchmarkDotNet to compare both!

Credit for adding .NET 7 support in [#1816](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1816) goes to [@am11](https://github.com/am11). [@adamsitnik](https://github.com/adamsitnik) implemented .NET 4.8.1 support in [#2044](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2044) and [#2067](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2067). Big thanks to [@MichalPetryka](https://github.com/MichalPetryka) who was using preview versions of BenchmarkDotNet and reported a bug related to .NET 4.8.1 support: [#2059](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2059) that got fixed before we released a new version.

### NativeAOT

We are really excited to see the experimental CoreRT project grow and become officially supported by Microsoft (under new name: NativeAOT)! You can read more about it [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7-preview-3/#what-is-native-aot).

As every AOT solution, NativeAOT has some [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/nativeaot/docs/limitations.md) like limited reflection support or lack of dynamic assembly loading. Because of that, the host process (what you run from command line) is never an AOT process, but just a regular .NET process. This process (called Host process) uses reflection to read benchmarks metadata (find all `[Benchmark]` methods etc.), generates a new project that references the benchmarks and compiles it using ILCompiler. The boilerplate code is not using reflection, so the project is built with `TrimmerDefaultAction=link` (we have greatly reduced build time thanks to that). Such compilation produces a native executable, which is later started by the Host process. This process (called Benchmark or Child process) performs the actual benchmarking and reports the results back to the Host process. By default BenchmarkDotNet uses the latest version of `Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` to build the NativeAOT benchmark according to [this instructions](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/nativeaot/docs/compiling.md). Moreover, BenchmarkDotNet by default uses current machines CPU features (change: [#1994](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1994), discussion: [#2061](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2061)) and if you don't like this behavior, you can [disable it](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2061#issuecomment-1203602177).

This is why you need to:
- install [pre-requisites](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/nativeaot/docs/prerequisites.md) required by NativeAOT compiler
- target .NET to be able to run NativeAOT benchmarks (example: `<TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>` in the .csproj file)
- run the app as a .NET process (example: `dotnet run -c Release -f net7.0`).
- specify the NativeAOT runtime in an explicit way, either by using console line arguments `--runtimes nativeaot7.0` (the recommended approach), or by using`[SimpleJob]` attribute or by using the fluent Job config API `Job.ShortRun.With(NativeAotRuntime.Net70)`:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f net7.0 --runtimes nativeaot7.0
```

For more examples please go to [docs](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/configs/toolchains.html#nativeaot).

Some of .NET features are not supported by Native AOT, that is why you may want to filter them out using new `[AotFilter]` attribute:

```cs
[AotFilter("Currently not supported due to missing metadata.")]
public class Xml_FromStream<T>
```

## New features and improvements

### Hiding Columns

In [#1621](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1621) [@marcnet80](https://github.com/marcnet80) has reduced the number of columns displayed when multiple runtimes are being compared.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6011991/99952390-defab180-2d7f-11eb-851c-ffef6fbb0647.png#mid)

In [#1890](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1890) [@YegorStepanov](https://github.com/YegorStepanov) has implemented a set of new APIs that allow for hiding columns. It's also exposed via `-h` and `--hide` command line arguments.

```cs
[MemoryDiagnoser] // adds Gen0, Gen1, Gen2 and Allocated Bytes columns
[HideColumns(Column.Gen0, Column.Gen1, Column.Gen2)] // dont display GenX columns
public class IntroHidingColumns
{
    [Benchmark]
    public byte[] AllocateArray() => new byte[100_000];
}
```

Sample results without `[HideColumns]`:


|        Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev |    Gen0 |    Gen1 |    Gen2 | Allocated |
|-------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|
| AllocateArray | 3.303 us | 0.0465 us | 0.0435 us | 31.2462 | 31.2462 | 31.2462 |  97.69 KB |

With:

|        Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Allocated |
|-------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| AllocateArray | 3.489 us | 0.0662 us | 0.0763 us |  97.69 KB |

Imagine how much time [@YegorStepanov](https://github.com/YegorStepanov) has saved to all the people who so far were removing the columns manually from the results before publishing them on GitHub!

### Allocation Ratio Column

In [#1859](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1859) [@YegorStepanov](https://github.com/YegorStepanov) has added Allocation Ratio Column. It's enabled by default when `MemoryDiagnoser` is used and one of the benchmarks is marked as `[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]` or when there are multuple jobs defined and one of them is marked as baseline.

```cs
[MemoryDiagnoser]
public class AllocationColumnSample
{
    [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
    [Arguments("test")]
    public string Builder(string value)
    {
        StringBuilder sb = new (value);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            sb.Append(value);

        return sb.ToString();
    }

    [Benchmark]
    [Arguments("test")]
    public string Concatenation(string value)
    {
        string result = value;

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            result += value;

        return result;
    }
}
```

|        Method | value |     Mean |   Error |  StdDev | Ratio |  Gen 0 | Allocated | Alloc Ratio |
|-------------- |------ |---------:|--------:|--------:|------:|-------:|----------:|------------:|
|       Builder |  test | 127.9 ns | 0.49 ns | 0.43 ns |  1.00 | 0.0544 |     456 B |        1.00 |
| Concatenation |  test | 120.2 ns | 0.94 ns | 0.88 ns |  0.94 | 0.0908 |     760 B |        1.67 |

### Progress and estimated finish time

In [#1909](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1909) [@adamsitnik](https://github.com/adamsitnik) has added logging of progress and estimated finish time.

```log
// ** Remained 5211 (99.9%) benchmark(s) to run. Estimated finish 2022-08-25 22:26 (9h 7m from now) **
```

### arm64 support for BenchmarkDotNet.Diagnostics.Windows package

Due to the [update](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2030) to [TraceEvent 3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent) `BenchmarkDotNet.Diagnostics.Windows` package has now arm64 support. Which means that you can use `EtwProfiler` and other ETW-based diagnosers on Windows arm64.

It would not be possible without [@brianrob](https://github.com/brianrob) who implemented arm64 support for TraceEvent in [#1533](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview/pull/1533)!

### Hardware Intrinsics information

In [#2051](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2051) [@adamsitnik](https://github.com/adamsitnik) has extended the hardware information printed in the Summary table with Hardware Intrinsics information.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6011991/180951306-bf8c9f8f-469a-4d7c-8ee1-d7fa47acc0e1.png#mid)

Sine the space in Summary table is quite limited, we full information is printed only in the log:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6011991/180951531-38c6b6d0-ba6f-4766-a305-b2e306e8420b.png#mid)

Special thanks to [@tannergooding](https://github.com/tannergooding) who provided a lot of [very valuable feedback](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2051#issuecomment-1194368152) and [@MichalPetryka](https://github.com/MichalPetryka) who contributed an improvement [#2066](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2066) for older runtimes.

### Glob filters support for DisassemblyDiagnoser

So far, the disassembler was always loading the type that was generated by BDN, searching for the benchmark method, disassembling it and when encountered direct method calls, disassembling the called methods as well (if their depth was lesser or equal to max configured depth).

This was working fine, but only for direct method calls. For indirect, the disassembly was incomplete.

In [#2072](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2072) [@adamsitnik](https://github.com/adamsitnik) has added the possibility to filter methods disassembled by the `DisassemblyDiagnoser`.

The users can now pass `--disasmFilter $globPattern` and it's going to be applied to full signatures of all methods available for disassembling. Examples:
* `--disasmFilter *System.Text*` - disassemble all `System.Text` methods.
* `--disasmFilter *` - disassemble all possible methods.

Moreover, [ClrMD](https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd) was updated to v2 ([#2040](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2040)) and few disassembler bugs have been fixed ([#2075](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2075), [#2078](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2078)). We are expecting that the disassembler will be more reliable now.
