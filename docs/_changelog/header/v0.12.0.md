It's been several months since our last release, but we have been working hard and have some new features for you!

## Highlights

* **Features and major improvements**
  * **Advanced multiple target frameworks support**  
    Now BenchmarkDotNet supports .NET Framework 4.8, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 5.0.
    Also, we reworked our API that allows targeting several runtimes from the same config:
      the new API is more consistent, flexible, and powerful.
    For example, if you want to execute your benchmarking using .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET Core 3.1,
      you can use the `SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.Net48)`, `[SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.NetCoreApp31)]` attributes or
      `Job.Default.With(ClrRuntime.Net48)`, `Job.Default.With(CoreRuntime.Core31)` jobs in a manual config.
    You can find more details below.

    [#1186](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1186),
    [#1236](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1236)
  * **Official templates for BenchmarkDotNet-based projects**  
    With the help of the [BenchmarkDotNet.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenchmarkDotNet.Templates/) NuGet package,
      you can easily create new projects from the command line via `dotnet new benchmark`.
    This command has a lot of useful options, so you can customize your new project as you want.
    [#1044](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1044)
  * **New NativeMemoryProfiler**  
    `NativeMemoryProfiler` measure the native memory traffic and adds the extra columns `Allocated native memory` and `Native memory leak` to the summary table.
    Internally, it uses `EtwProfiler` to profile the code using ETW.

    [#1131](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1131),
    [#1208](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1208),
    [#1214](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1214),
    [#1218](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1218),
    [#1219](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1219)
  * **New ThreadingDiagnoser**  
    `ThreadingDiagnoser` also adds two extra columns to the summary table:
      `Completed Work Items` (the number of work items that have been processed in ThreadPool per single operation) and
      `Lock Contentions` (the number of times there *was contention* upon trying to take a Monitor's lock per single operation).
    Internally, it uses [new APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/35500) exposed in .NET Core 3.0.
    [#1154](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1154),
    [#1227](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1227)
  * **Improved MemoryDiagnoser**  
    Now `MemoryDiagnoser` includes memory allocated by *all threads* that were live during benchmark execution: a new GC API was exposed in .NET Core 3.0 preview6+.
    It allows to get the number of allocated bytes for all threads.
    [#1155](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1155),
    [#1153](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1153),
    [#723](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/723)
  * **LINQPad 6 support**  
    Now both LINQPad 5 and LINQPad 6 are supported!
    [#1241](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1241),
    [#1245](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1245)
  * **Fast documentation search**  
    We continue to improve the usability of our documentation.
    In this release, we improved the search experience in the documentation: now it works almost instantly with the help of [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) engine!
    [#1148](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1148),
    [#1158](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1158)
* **Minor summary and exporter improvements**
  * **Improved presentation of the current architecture in the environment information**  
    In the previous version of BenchmarkDotNet, the reports always contained "64bit" or "32bit" which did not tell if it was ARM or not.
    Now it prints the full architecture name (`x64`, `x86`, `ARM`, or `ARM64`).
    For example, instead of `.NET Framework 4.8 (4.8.3815.0), 64bit RyuJIT` you will get `.NET Framework 4.8 (4.8.3815.0), X64 RyuJIT` or `.NET Framework 4.8 (4.8.3815.0), ARM64 RyuJIT`.
    [#1213](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1213)
  * **Simplified reports for Full .NET Framework version**  
    Previous version: `.NET Framework 4.7.2 (CLR 4.0.30319.42000), 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.3324.0`.
    Current version: `.NET Framework 4.7.2 (4.7.3362.0), 64bit RyuJIT`.
    [#1114](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1114),
    [#1111](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1111)
  * **More reliable CPU info on Windows**  
    We added a workaround to for a bug in wmic that uses `\r\r\n` as a line separator.
    [#1144](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1144),
    [#1145](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1145)
  * **Better naming for generated plots**  
    When `[RPlotExporter]` is used, BenchmarkDotNet generates a lot of useful plots in the `BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts` folder.
    The naming of the plot files was improved: benchmarks without `Params` doesn't include a double dash (`--`) in their names anymore.
    [1183](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1183),
    [1212](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1212)
  * **Better density plot precision**
    The previous version of BenchmarkDotNet used the rule-of-thumb bandwidth selector in `RPlotExporter` density plots.
    It was fine for unimodal distributions, but sometimes it produced misleading plots for multimodal distributions.
    Now, RPlotExporter uses the Sheather&Jones bandwidth selector that significantly improves the presentation of the density plots for complex distributions.
    [58fde64](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/58fde64c809ceadb3fca9d677a7cec83071b833f)
  * **Better alignment in `HtmlExporter`**  
    Now BenchmarkDotNet aligns the content exported by `HtmlExporter` to the right.
    [#1189](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1189)
    [dfa074](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/dfa074b024cfa8bbe4fe175d3d65a3d9f85127ff)
  * **Better precision calculation in SummaryTable**  
    [4e9eb43](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/4e9eb4335eee05a95a3766f2c81ae260508021af)
  * **Better summary analysis**  
    BenchmarkDotNet warns the user when benchmark baseline value is too close to zero and the columns derived from BaselineCustomColumn cannot be computed.
    [#1161](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1161),
    [#600](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/600)
  * **Make log file datetime format 24-hour**  
    [#1149](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1149)
  * **Improve AskUser prompt message**  
    The error messages will surround `*` by quotes on Linux and macOS.
    [#1147](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1147)
* **Minor API improvements**
  * **ED-PELT algorithm for changepoint detection is now available**  
    You can find details in [this blog post](https://aakinshin.net/posts/edpelt/).
    [f89091](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/f89091a2a9c1a4058dd8e32d5aa01271910dd7dc)
  * **Improved OutlierMode API**  
    BenchmarkDotNet performs measurement postprocessing that may remove some of the outlier values (it can be useful to remove upper outliers that we get because of the natural CPU noise).
    In the previous version, naming for the `OutlierMode` values was pretty confusing: `None/OnlyUpper/OnlyLower/All`.
    Now, these values were renamed to `DontRemove/RemoveUpper/RemoveLower/RemoveAll`.
    For example, if you want to remove all the outliers, you can annotate your benchmark with the `[Outliers(OutlierMode.RemoveAll)]` attribute.
    The old names still exist (to make sure that the changes are backward compatible), but they are marked as obsolete, and they will be removed in the future versions of the library.

  * **Add the possibility to pass `Config` to `BenchmarkSwitcher.RunAll` and `RunAllJoined`**  
    [#1194](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1194),
    [ae23bd](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/ae23bddebe49cd66a9627790c073b7bc45ccbf5c)
  * **Improved command line experience**  
    When user uses `--packages $path`, the `$path` will be sent to the dotnet build command as well.
    [1187](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1187)
  * **Extend the list of supported power plans.**
    Now it supports "ultimate", "balanced", and "power saver" plans.

## Advanced multiple target frameworks support

Now BenchmarkDotNet supports .NET Framework 4.8, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 5.0.
Also, we reworked our API that allows targeting several runtimes from the same config:
  the new API is more consistent, flexible, and powerful.
For example, if you want to execute your benchmarking using .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET Core 3.1,
  you can use the `SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.Net48)`, `[SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.NetCoreApp31)]` attributes or
  `Job.Default.With(ClrRuntime.Net48)`, `Job.Default.With(CoreRuntime.Core31)` jobs in a manual config.

Now let's discuss how to use it in detail.
If you want to test multiple frameworks, your project file **MUST target all of them** and you **MUST install the corresponding SDKs**:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.0;netcoreapp2.1;net48</TargetFrameworks>
```

If you run your benchmarks without specifying any custom settings, BenchmarkDotNet is going to run the benchmarks **using the same framework as the host process** (it corresponds to `RuntimeMoniker.HostProcess`):

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp2.1 # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 2.1
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp3.0 # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 3.0
dotnet run -c Release -f net48         # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET 4.8
mono $pathToExe                        # is going to run the benchmarks using Mono from your PATH
```

To run the benchmarks for multiple runtimes with a single command from the command line, you need to specify the runtime moniker names via `--runtimes|-r` console argument:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp2.1 --runtimes netcoreapp2.1 netcoreapp3.0 # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 2.1 and .NET Core 3.0
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp2.1 --runtimes netcoreapp2.1 net48         # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 2.1 and .NET 4.8
```

What is going to happen if you provide multiple Full .NET Framework monikers?
Let's say:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f net461 net472 net48
```

Full .NET Framework always runs every .NET executable using the latest .NET Framework available on a given machine.
If you try to run the benchmarks for a few .NET TFMs, they are all going to be executed using the latest .NET Framework from your machine.
The only difference is that they are all going to have different features enabled depending on the target version they were compiled for.
You can read more about this
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/version-compatibility) and
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility).
This is **.NET Framework behavior which can not be controlled by BenchmarkDotNet or any other tool**.

**Note:** Console arguments support works only if you pass the `args` to `BenchmarkSwitcher`:

```cs
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args) 
        => BenchmarkSwitcher
            .FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly)
            .Run(args); // crucial to make it work
}
```

You can achieve the same thing using `[SimpleJobAttribute]`:

```cs
using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Jobs;

namespace BenchmarkDotNet.Samples
{
    [SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.Net48)]
    [SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.Mono)]
    [SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.NetCoreApp21)]
    [SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.NetCoreApp30)]
    public class TheClassWithBenchmarks
```

Or using a custom config:

```cs
using BenchmarkDotNet.Configs;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Environments;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Jobs;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;

namespace BenchmarkDotNet.Samples
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var config = DefaultConfig.Instance
                .With(Job.Default.With(CoreRuntime.Core21))
                .With(Job.Default.With(CoreRuntime.Core30))
                .With(Job.Default.With(ClrRuntime.Net48))
                .With(Job.Default.With(MonoRuntime.Default));

            BenchmarkSwitcher
                .FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly)
                .Run(args, config);
        }
    }
}
```

The recommended way of running the benchmarks for multiple runtimes is to use the `--runtimes` console line argument.
By using the console line argument, you don't need to edit the source code anytime you want to change the list of runtimes.
Moreover, if you share the source code of the benchmark, other people can run it even if they don't have the exact same framework version installed.

## Official templates for BenchmarkDotNet-based projects

Since v0.12.0, BenchmarkDotNet provides project templates to setup your benchmarks easily.
The template exists for each major .NET language ([C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/) and [VB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/)) with equivalent features and structure.
The templates require the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Once installed, run the following command to install the templates:

```log
dotnet new -i BenchmarkDotNet.Templates
```

If you want to uninstall all BenchmarkDotNet templates:

```log
dotnet new -u BenchmarkDotNet.Templates
```

The template is a NuGet package distributed over nuget.org: [BenchmarkDotNet.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenchmarkDotNet.Templates/).
To create a new C# benchmark library project from the template, run:

```log
dotnet new benchmark
```

If you'd like to create F# or VB project, you can specify project language with `-lang` option:

```log
dotnet new benchmark -lang F#
dotnet new benchmark -lang VB
```

The template projects have five additional options - all of them are optional.
By default, a class library project targeting netstandard2.0 is created.
You can specify `-f` or `--frameworks` to change target to one or more frameworks:

```log
dotnet new benchmark -f netstandard2.0;net472
```

The option `--console-app` creates a console app project targeting `netcoreapp3.0` with an entry point:

```log
dotnet new benchmark --console-app
```

This lets you run the benchmarks from a console (`dotnet run`) or from your favorite IDE.
The option `-f` or `--frameworks` will be ignored when `--console-app` is set.
The option `-b` or `--benchmarkName` sets the name of the benchmark class:

```log
dotnet new benchmark -b Md5VsSha256
```

BenchmarkDotNet lets you create a dedicated configuration class (see [Configs](xref:docs.configs)) to customize the execution of your benchmarks.
To create a benchmark project with a configuration class, use the option `-c` or `--config`:

```log
dotnet new benchmark -c
```

The option `--no-restore` if specified, skips the automatic NuGet restore after the project is created:

```log
dotnet new benchmark --no-restore
```

Use the `-h` or `--help` option to display all possible arguments with a description and the default values:

```log
dotnet new benchmark --help
```

The version of the template NuGet package is synced with the [BenchmarkDotNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenchmarkDotNet/) package.
For instance, the template version `0.12.0` is referencing [BenchmarkDotnet 0.12.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenchmarkDotNet/0.12.0) - there is no floating version behavior.
For more info about the `dotnet new` CLI, please read [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet).

## New NativeMemoryProfiler

`NativeMemoryProfiler` measure the native memory traffic and adds the extra columns `Allocated native memory` and `Native memory leak` to the summary table.
Internally, it uses `EtwProfiler` to profile the code using ETW.

Consider the following benchmark:

```cs
[ShortRunJob]
[NativeMemoryProfiler]
[MemoryDiagnoser]
public class IntroNativeMemory
{
    [Benchmark]
    public void BitmapWithLeaks()
    {
        var flag = new Bitmap(200, 100);
        var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(flag);
        var blackPen = new Pen(Color.Black, 3);
        graphics.DrawLine(blackPen, 100, 100, 500, 100);
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public void Bitmap()
    {
        using (var flag = new Bitmap(200, 100))
        {
            using (var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(flag))
            {
                using (var blackPen = new Pen(Color.Black, 3))
                {
                    graphics.DrawLine(blackPen, 100, 100, 500, 100);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private const int Size = 20; // Greater value could cause System.OutOfMemoryException for test with memory leaks.
    private int ArraySize = Size * Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(int));

    [Benchmark]
    public unsafe void AllocHGlobal()
    {
        IntPtr unmanagedHandle = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(ArraySize);
        Span<byte> unmanaged = new Span<byte>(unmanagedHandle.ToPointer(), ArraySize);
        Marshal.FreeHGlobal(unmanagedHandle);
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public unsafe void AllocHGlobalWithLeaks()
    {
        IntPtr unmanagedHandle = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(ArraySize);
        Span<byte> unmanaged = new Span<byte>(unmanagedHandle.ToPointer(), ArraySize);
    }
}
```

It will produce the summary table like this one:

|                Method |         Mean |         Error |       StdDev | Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated | Allocated native memory | Native memory leak |

As you can see, we have two additional columns `Allocated native memory` and `Native memory leak` that contain some very useful numbers!

## New ThreadingDiagnoser

`ThreadingDiagnoser` also adds two extra columns to the summary table:

* `Completed Work Items`: The number of work items that have been processed in ThreadPool (per single operation)
* `Lock Contentions`: The number of times there **was contention** upon trying to take a Monitor's lock (per single operation)

Internally, it uses [new APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/35500) exposed in .NET Core 3.0.

It can be activated with the help of the `[ThreadingDiagnoser]` attribute:

```cs
[ThreadingDiagnoser]
public class IntroThreadingDiagnoser
{
    [Benchmark]
    public void CompleteOneWorkItem()
    {
        ManualResetEvent done = new ManualResetEvent(initialState: false);
        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(m => (m as ManualResetEvent).Set(), done);
        done.WaitOne();
    }
}
```

The above example will print a summary table like this one:

|              Method |          Mean |     StdDev |        Median | Completed Work Items | Lock Contentions |
|-------------------- |--------------:|-----------:|--------------:|---------------------:|-----------------:|
| CompleteOneWorkItem | 8,073.5519 ns | 69.7261 ns | 8,111.6074 ns |               1.0000 |                - |

## Fast documentation search

We continue to improve the usability of our documentation.
In this release, we improved the search experience in the documentation: now it works almost instantly with the help of [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) engine!
That's how it looks:
