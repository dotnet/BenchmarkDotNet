It's been few months since our last release, but we have been working hard and have some new features for you!

## Highlights

* **Features**
  * **NativeMemoryDiagnoser** - it uses `EtwProfiler` to profile the code using ETW and adds the extra columns `Allocated native memory` and `Native memory leak`.
    [#457](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/457),
    [#1131](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1131),

    [#1155](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1155),
    [#1153](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1153),

    [#1185](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/1185)

    [#1146](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1146)

## NativeMemoryDiagnoser

The `NativeMemoryDiagnoser` diagnoser uses `EtwProfiler` to profile the code using ETW and adds the extra columns `Allocated native memory` and `Native memory leak` to the benchmark results table.

### Profiling memory leaks

The BenchmarkDotNet repeats benchmarking function many times. Sometimes it can cause a memory overflow. In this case, the BenchmarkDotNet shows the message: 

```ini
OutOfMemoryException!
BenchmarkDotNet continues to run additional iterations until desired accuracy level is achieved. It's possible only if the benchmark method doesn't have any side-effects.
If your benchmark allocates memory and keeps it alive, you are creating a memory leak.
You should redesign your benchmark and remove the side-effects. You can use `OperationsPerInvoke`, `IterationSetup` and `IterationCleanup` to do that.
```

In this case, you should try to reduce the number of invocation, by adding `[ShortRunJob]` attribute or using `Job.Short` for custom configuration.

## ThreadingDiagnoser

The `ThreadingDiagnoser` uses [new APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/35500) exposed in .NET Core 3.0 to report:

* Completed Work Items: The number of work items that have been processed in ThreadPool (per single operation)
* Lock Contentions: The number of times there **was contention** upon trying to take a Monitor's lock (per single operation)

### Source code

## Multiple frameworks support


If you want to test multiple frameworks, your project file **MUST target all of them** and you **MUST install the corresponding SDKs**:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.0;netcoreapp2.1;net48</TargetFrameworks>
```

If you run your benchmarks without specifying any custom settings, BenchmarkDotNet is going to run the benchmarks **using the same framework as the host process**:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp2.1 # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 2.1
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp3.0 # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 3.0
dotnet run -c Release -f net48         # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET 4.8
mono $pathToExe                        # is going to run the benchmarks using Mono from your PATH
```

To run the benchmarks for multiple runtimes with a single command, you need to specify the target framework moniker names via `--runtimes|-r` console argument:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp2.1 --runtimes netcoreapp2.1 netcoreapp3.0 # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 2.1 and .NET Core 3.0
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp2.1 --runtimes netcoreapp2.1 net48         # is going to run the benchmarks using .NET Core 2.1 and .NET 4.8
```

What is going to happen if you provide multiple Full .NET Framework monikers? Let's say:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f net461 net472 net48
```

Full .NET Framework always runs every .NET executable using the latest .NET Framework available on a given machine. If you try to run the benchmarks for a few .NET TFMs, they are all going to be executed using the latest .NET Framework from your machine. The only difference is that they are all going to have different features enabled depending on target version they were compiled for. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/version-compatibility) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility). This is **.NET Framework behavior which can not be controlled by BenchmarkDotNet or any other tool**.

**Note:** Console arguments support works only if you pass the `args` to `BenchmarkSwitcher`:

```cs
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args) 
        => BenchmarkSwitcher
            .FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly)
            .Run(args); // crucial to make it work
}
```

You can achieve the same thing using `[TargetFrameworkJobAttribute]`:

```cs
using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Jobs;

namespace BenchmarkDotNet.Samples
{
    [TargetFrameworkJob(TargetFrameworkMoniker.Net48)]
    [TargetFrameworkJob(TargetFrameworkMoniker.Mono)]
    [TargetFrameworkJob(TargetFrameworkMoniker.NetCoreApp21)]
    [TargetFrameworkJob(TargetFrameworkMoniker.NetCoreApp30)]
    public class TheClassWithBenchmarks
```

Or using a custom config:

```cs
using BenchmarkDotNet.Configs;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Environments;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Jobs;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;

namespace BenchmarkDotNet.Samples
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var config = DefaultConfig.Instance
                .With(Job.Default.With(CoreRuntime.Core21))
                .With(Job.Default.With(CoreRuntime.Core30))
                .With(Job.Default.With(ClrRuntime.Net48))
                .With(Job.Default.With(MonoRuntime.Default));

            BenchmarkSwitcher
                .FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly)
                .Run(args, config);
        }
    }
}
```

The recommended way of running the benchmarks for multiple runtimes is to use the `--runtimes` console line argument. By using the console line argument you don't need to edit the source code anytime you want to change the list of runtimes. Moreover, if you share the source code of the benchmark other people can run it even if they don't have the exact same framework version installed.
