## Highlights

* The default build toolchains have been updated to pass `IntermediateOutputPath`, `OutputPath`, and `OutDir` properties to the `dotnet build` command. This change forces all build outputs to be placed in a new directory generated by BenchmarkDotNet, and fixes many issues that have been reported with builds. You can also access these paths in your own `.csproj` and `.props` from those properties if you need to copy custom files to the output.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed multiple build-related bugs including passing MsBuildArguments and .Net 8's `UseArtifactsOutput`.

## Breaking Changes

* `DotNetCliBuilder` removed `retryFailedBuildWithNoDeps` constructor option.
* `DotNetCliCommand` removed `RetryFailedBuildWithNoDeps` property and `BuildNoRestoreNoDependencies()` and `PublishNoBuildAndNoRestore()` methods (replaced with `PublishNoRestore()`).
