# Building

For building the BenchmarkDotNet source-code, the following elements are required:

* [Visual Studio 2017 (Version 15.0.26228.9 or newer) with .NET Core development tools installed](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-2017/)
* Internet connection and disk space to download all the required packages

If your build fails because some packages are not available, let say F#, then just disable these project and hope for nuget server to work later on ;)
