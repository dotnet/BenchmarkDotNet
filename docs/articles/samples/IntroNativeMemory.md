## Sample: IntroNativeMemory

The `NativeMemoryDiagnoser` diagnoser uses `EtwProfiler` to profile the code using ETW and adds the extra columns `Allocated native memory` and `Native memory leak` to the benchmark results table.

### Profiling memory leaks

The BenchmarkDotNet repeats benchmarking function many times. Sometimes it can cause a memory overflow. In this case, the BenchmarkDotNet shows the message: 

```ini
OutOfMemoryException!
BenchmarkDotNet continues to run additional iterations until desired accuracy level is achieved. It's possible only if the benchmark method doesn't have any side-effects.
If your benchmark allocates memory and keeps it alive, you are creating a memory leak.
You should redesign your benchmark and remove the side-effects. You can use `OperationsPerInvoke`, `IterationSetup` and `IterationCleanup` to do that.
```

In this case, you should try to reduce the number of invocation, by adding `[ShortRunJob]` attribute or using `Job.Short` for custom configuration.
