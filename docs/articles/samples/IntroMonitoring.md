## Sample: IntroMonitoring

If a benchmark method takes at least 100ms, you can also use the `Monitoring` strategy.
In this case, the pilot stage will be omitted, by default you get 1 iteration = 1 operation
  (or you can manually set amount of operation in an iteration).
Also you can use `[IterationSetup]` and `[IterationCleanup]` in this case: it shouldn't affect time measurements
  (but it can affect results of MemoryDiagnoser).
It's a perfect mode for benchmarks which doesn't have a steady state and the performance distribution is tricky:
  `Monitoring` will help you to collect a set of measurements and get statistics.

### Usage

```cs
[SimpleJob(RunStrategy.Monitoring, launchCount: 10, warmupCount: 0, targetCount: 100)]
public class MyBenchmarkClass
```
