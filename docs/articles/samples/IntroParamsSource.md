## Sample: IntroParamsSource

In case you want to use a lot of values, you should use
  [`[ParamsSource]`](xref:BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes.ParamsSourceAttribute)
You can mark one or several fields or properties in your class by the
  [`[Params]`](xref:BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes.ParamsAttribute) attribute.
In this attribute, you have to specify the name of public method/property which is going to provide the values
  (something that implements `IEnumerable`).
The source must be within benchmarked type!

### Remarks

**A remark about IParam.**

You don't need to use `IParam` anymore since `0.11.0`.
Just use complex types as you wish and override `ToString` method to change the display names used in the results.
