# Running Tests

To run all tests just run the following command in the repo root:

```cmd
dotnet test -c Release BenchmarkDotNet.sln
```

Most of the tests projects target `net461` and `net5.0`. If the change that you want to test is not specific to any particular runtime, you can run the tests for one of them.

```cmd
dotnet test -c Release -f net5.0 BenchmarkDotNet.sln
```

You should be able to run all of tests from your IDE as well.

## Approval Tests

For some unit tests (e.g. for exporter tests) BenchmarkDotNet uses [approval tests'](http://approvaltests.sourceforge.net/) implementation for .NET: [ApprovalTests.Net](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net).
* The expected value for each test is stored in a `*.approved.txt` file located near the test source file in the repository. ApprovalTests.NET generates approved file's names automatically according test name and its parameters. This files must be added under the source control.
* It also creates a `*.received` file for each failed test. You can use different reporters for convenient file comparison. By default we use XUnit2Reporter, so you can find test run results on the test runner console as usual. You can add [UseReporter(typeof(KDiffReporter))] on test class and then ApprovalTests will open KDiff for each failed test. This way you can easily understand what's the difference between approved and received values and choose the correct one.
