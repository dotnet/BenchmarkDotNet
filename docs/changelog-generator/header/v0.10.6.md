* Removed buggy allocation from Engine which was spoiling the results of MemoryDiagnoser for micro benchmarks. This part of the code is now guarded with very strict integration tests, it should never happen again. We now also exclude the side effects of the Allocation Quantum. **This bug was serious, you must update to `0.10.6`** ([#439](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/439))
* Support of the `PackageTargetFallback` setting which allows to reference components that target old framework monikers (like `dotnet5.4` or `portable-net45+win8`) ([#438](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/438))
* Added `InstructionRetiredPerCycleColumn` which shows up automatically when `HardwareCounter.InstructionRetired` and `HardwareCounter.TotalCycles` are used.
* Support benchmark classes without namespace ([#446](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/446))
* Fix problem with RPlotExporter and quoted directories in %PATH% ([#446](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/446))
* Show Windows brand version in summary
