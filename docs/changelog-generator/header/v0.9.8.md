* CoreCLR RTM support (see [#216](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/216)). **Breaking change:** we have dropped dnx451 and dnxcore50 support.
* Migration from MSBuild to Roslyn, which supports Mono on Linux and MacOS (see [#149](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/149)).  **Breaking change:** we have dropped .NET 4.0 support.
* Ability to manage GC mode: turn on/off the Server/Concurrent GC modes, extend to CPU groups, set gcAllowVeryLargeObjects and avoid BenchmarkDotNet from forcing GC.Collect (see [#188](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/188),  [#76](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/76) and [#211](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/211))
* Support CopyToOutput (see [#212](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/212)). Now you can use native dependencies as well as custom files.
* Copying custom settings from app.config (see [#108](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/108)). It means we support assembly binding redirects as well as custom connection strings etc.
* AsciiDocExporter (see [#169](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/169))
* Framework setting in Job has been removed (see [#194](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/194))
* Minor bugfixes and improvements
