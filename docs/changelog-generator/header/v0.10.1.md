* MemoryDiagnoser got improved. The changes:
  * Memory Diagnoser is now part of BenchmarkDotNet.Core.dll, and it's **enabled by default**
  * MemoryDiagnoser is **100% accurate** about allocated memory when using default settings or Job.ShortRun or any longer job. (see [#284](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/284))
  * Memory Diagnoser no longer includes allocations from Cleanup/Setup methods (see [#186](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/186))
  * the results are now scaled so they are stable across the runs. (see [#133](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/133))
* .NET Core 1.1+ support, we no longer support 1.0, we target netcoreapp1.1 now. Reason: we wanted to use `GC.GetAllocatedBytesForCurrentThread` in MemoryDiagnoser which is available only in 1.1+
* Improved information about environment in summary
* Minor bugfixes
