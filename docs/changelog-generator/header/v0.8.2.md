* Changes in the Summary table
  * Summary table now supports ResultExtenders that can add new column to the table
  * Now we use [StandardError](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) (aka `Error`) as the main accuracy metric
  * Columns `op/s`, `StdDev` are disabled by default (you can add it via ResultExtenders)
* Statistic improvements, now you have detailed statistic in the console log like follows:
```
Mean = 118.5298 us, StdError = 1.2863 us (N = 30, StdDev = 7.0454 us)
Min = 109.1602 us, Median = 117.1794 us, Max = 132.5764 us
IQR = 10.1244 us, LowerFence = 98.0834 us, UpperFence = 138.5810 us
ConfidenceInterval = [116.0086 us; 121.0510 us] (CI 95%)
```
* Added the `Baseline` feature, see [#64](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/64)
* Export improvements, now you have files `<BenchmarkName>-report-github.md`, `<BenchmarkName>-report-stackoverflow.md` for easy publishing results on GitHub and StackOverflow.
* Basic plotting. Added new `BenchmarkRPlotExporter` that creates `BuildPlots.R` in the bin directory. It is an R script that generates boxplot and barplot for your benchmarks (you should have installed R with defined `R_HOME` environment variable)
* Updated environment info
  * Added Stopwatch `Frequency` and `Resolution`
  * Split common benchmark properties (like `Mode`, `Platform`, `Runtime`) in several lines (3 properties per line)
* Log improvements: add total time, statistics, list of exported files
* Bug fixes
