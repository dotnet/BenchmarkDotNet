            code:TraceEventParser Represents a class that knows how to decode particular set of events (typcially
            grouped by provider). It is the embodyment of all the type information that is typically stored in a
            ETW MOF file (Windows XP events) or an ETW manifest (Vista events). It is expected that a
            TraceEventParser can be generated completely mechanically from a MOF or ETW manifest (it really is
            just a decoder of that type information).
            
            There is no static interface associated with a TraceEventParser, but there is a dynamic one. It is
            expected that TraceEventsParsers have a set of public event APIs of the form
            
                public event Action[SubclassOfTraceEvent] EventName
            
            which allows users of the parser to subscribe to callbacks (in the case about called 'EventName'. The
            callback take a single argument (in this case SubclassOfTraceEvent) which is passed to the callback.
            
            TraceEventParsers typically are constructed with a constructor that takes a code:TraceEventSource.
            The parser remembers the source, and when users subscribe to events on the code:TraceEventParser, the
            parser in turn calls code:TraceEventSource.RegisterEventTemplate with the correct subclass of
            code:TraceEvent that knows how to decode all the fields a a paraticular event.
            
            Thus a code:TraceEventParser has built int support for a 'callback' model for subscribing to events.
            Parsers also support interacting with sources that support an iterator model. The code:TraceLog class
            is an example of this. In this model the user still 'registers' a parser with the source. When this
            registration happens, the source in turn calls back to the code:TraceEventParser.All event on the
            parser registering a 'null' callback. This causes the parser to register all events with the source
            with null callbacks. The callbacks are are never used (afer all, they are null), but the source
            needed the templates to be registered so the event payload data can be decoded.

             <summary>
             code:TraceEvent represents the data from one event. Logically a TraceEventSource is mostly just a
             stream of TraceEvent objects. An event is identified by a GUID (128 bit unique ID) of the event
             provider that generated it PLUS a small integer (must fit in a ushort) code:TraceEventID that
             distinguishes it among other events from the same provider.
             
             The provider GUID and the Event ID together uniquely identify the data format of the event. Event
             providers can provide a description of events and their payloads in a manifest that is traditionally
             defined by an XML file (in Windows Vista). For Pre-vista ETW, the descriptions are done with MOF
             files. There are tools that can convert a XML manifest description to C# that defines a
             code:TraceEventParser which can be used by this infrastructure.
            
             There are operations (Start, Stop), that are common to a broad set of differnet events (from
             different providers), that should be processed in simmiar ways. To make identifing these common kinds
             of events easier, events can be given an code:TraceEventOpcode which indentified these common
             patterns.
            
             While Event data can have arbitrary data in it, there is a header that every event must have.
             TraceEvent provides an interface to this header data and other operations that can be done without
             needing to know that exact layout of the event data. In particular every event knows its Provider
             GUID (but not necessarily its name), opcode number (but not necessarily its opocode name), the time
             it happened, the code:TraceEventLevel (how important the event is) the thread it happened on (not all
             events have an associated thread), and the size of the event-specific data.
             
             The basic architecture is that specific events (eg. the 'Process' event with opcode 'Start') define a
             new subclass of code:TraceEvent (eg. code:ProcessTraceData) that define properties that know how to
             parse the raw data into its various 'fields'.
             
             In addition a code:TraceEvent instance has support for the subscription model in the form a a the
             code:TraceEvent.Dispatch virtual function. Events can remember a user-defined callback and dispatch
             to that callback when the Dispatch' virtual methodIndex is called.
             
             An important restriction is that a TraceEvent becomes invalid after the callback is complete (it is
             reused for the next event of that type in the stream). Thus callers should NOT cache instances of the
             subclass of TraceEvent in their own data structures, but copy out the data they need or call
             code:TraceEvent.Clone if they need a permanent copy.

            code:TraceEventSource represents a list of events (eg a ETL file or ETLX file or a real time stream).
            There are two basic models for acessing such a list, either a callback model (where clients register
            their desire to know about particular events), and the iterator model (where you can use a 'foreach'
            on the list to get each event in turn. code:TraceEventSource represnts all those aspects of the list
            of event that is INDEPENDENT of which model you use. Thus code:TraceEventSource does not actually
            have the most interesting methods (Because the interesting methods deal with getting at the events)
            those actually are on sublasses
            
                * code:TraceEventDispatcher - is a subclass of code:TraceEventSource that supports the callback
                    model for accessing events. This interface can be used with 'real time' streams.
                * code:Diagnostics.Tracing.Parsers.TraceLog.TraceLog - is also a subclass of
                    code:TraceEventSource that supports the iteration model (through its
                    code:Diagnostics.Tracing.Parsers.TraceLog.TraceLog.Events property. This mechanism can only
                    be used on files, because it supports a much broader variety of access methods (eg moving
                    backwards, annotating events ...)
            
            Regardless of the model used to access the events, an important aspect of the system is that
            code:TraceEventSource does not know about the event-specific layout of an event (which allows new
            events to be added easily). Instead there needs to be a way for event specific
            parsers to register themselves (this is needed regarless of whether the callback or
            iterator model is used).  Providing the interface to do this is the primary purpose
            of code:TraceEventSource and is defined by the code:ITraceParserServices

            to 'hook' to so that events can be decoded.  code:ITraceParserServices is the API service for this
            second role.  It provides the methods that parsers use attach themselves to sources and register the

            RegisterEventTemplate is the mechanism a particular event payload description 'template' (a
            subclass of code:TraceEvent) is injected into the event processing stream. Once registered, an
            event is 'parsed' simply by setting the 'rawData' field in the event. It is up to the template
            then to take this raw data an present it in a useful way to the user (via properties). Note that
            parsing is thus 'lazy' in no processing of the raw data is not done at event dispatch time but
            only when the properties of an event are accessed.
            
            Another important aspect is that templates are reused by code:TraceEventSource agressively. The
            expectation is that no memory needs to be allocated during a normal dispatch (in fact only one
            field in the code:TraceEvent is set).

            Samples have stacks (lists of frames, each frame contains a name) associated with them.  This interface allows you to get 
            at this information.  We don't use normal objects to represent these but rather give each stack (and frame) a unique
            (dense) index.   This has a number of advantages over using objects to represent the stack.
            
                * Indexes are very serialization friendly, and this data will be presisted.  Thus indexes are the natural form for data on disk. 
                * It allows the data to be read from the serialized format (disk) lazily in a very straightfoward fashion, keeping only the
                    hottest elements in memory.  
                * Users of this API can associate additional data with the call stacks or frames trivially and efficiently simply by
                    having an array indexed by the stack or frame index.

            <summary>
            A caller callee view is a sumation which centers around one 'focus' node which is represented by the CallerCalleeNode.
            This node has a caller and callee list, and these nodes (as well as the CallerCalleNode itself) represent the aggregation
            over the entire tree.
            
            AccumlateSamplesForNode is the routine that takes a part of a aggregated call tree (repsesented by 'treeNode' and adds
            in the statistics for that call tree into the CallerCalleeNode aggregations (and its caller and callee lists).  
            
            'recursionsCount' is the number of times the focus node name has occured in the path from 'treeNode' to the root.   In 
            addition to setting the CallerCalleeNode aggregation, it also returns a 'weightedSummary' inclusive aggregation 
            FOR JUST treeNode (the CallerCalleNode is an aggregation over the entire call tree accumulated so far).  
            
            The key problem for this routine to avoid is double counting of inclusive samples in the face of recursive functions. 
            Thus all samples are weighted by the recurision count before being included in 'weightedSummaryRet (as well as in
            the CallerCalleeNode and its Callers and Callees).    
            
            An important optimization is the ability to NOT create (but rather reuse) CallTreeNodes when returning weightedSummaryRet.
            To accompish this the weightedSummaryScaleRet is needed.  To get the correct numerical value for weightedSummaryRet, you 
            actually have to scale values by weightedSummaryScaleRet before use.   This allows us to represent weights of 0 (subtree has 
            no calls to the focus node), or cases where the subtree is completely uniform in its weigthing (the subtree does not contain
            any additional focus nodes), by simply returning the tree node itself and scaling it by the recursion count).  
            
            isUniformRet is set to false if anyplace in 'treeNode' does not have the scaling factor weightedSummaryScaleRet.  This
            means the the caller cannot simply scale 'treeNode' by a weight to get weightedSummaryRet.

            <summary>
            Kernel traces have information about images that are loaded, however they don't have enough information
            in the events themselves to unambigously look up PDBs without looking at the data inside the images.
            This means that symbols can't be resolved unless you are on the same machine on which you gathered the data.
            
            XPERF solves this problem by adding new 'synthetic' events that it creates by looking at the trace and then
            opening each DLL mentioned and extracting the information needed to look PDBS up on a symbol server (this 
            includes the PE file's TimeDateStamp as well as a PDB Guid, and 'pdbAge' that can be found in the DLLs header.
            
            These new events are added when XPERF runs the 'merge' command (or -d flag is passed).  It is also exposed 
            through the KernelTraceControl.dll!CreateMergedTraceFile API.

            this has mostly be superseeded by the DbgID/RSDS event.

            The fact that EventIndex is a 32 bit number limits us to 4Gig events in a log.  Sample based profiling
            takes 1K samples per CPU per second.  Context switches and page faults can happen at about the same
            rate.  Thus 3K-6K is not uncommon and 10K /sec.  At that rate it will take 4E5 seconds == 111 hours
            == 4.6 days to exceed the limit.  Even at 100K / sec, it would be 11 hours of trace (Keep in mind
            we don't give StackTrace events IDs).   The file size would be greater than 100Gig which would make
            it REALLY painful to work with.  
            
            We choose as the event ID simply the index in the log file of the event.  Thus the IDs are dense as
            they can be.  We don't however guarentee ordering, as we probably want to be able to add new
            events to the stream, and these will be addded at the end even if they occur elsewhere in the time
            stream.

            #Introduction 
            
            A TraceEventSession represents a single ETW Tracing Session (something that logs a
            single output moduleFile). Every ETL output moduleFile has exactly one session assoicated with it,
            although you can have 'real time' sessions that have no output file and you can connect to
            'directly' to get events without ever creating a file. You signify this simply by passing
            'null' as the name of the file. You extract data from these 'real time' sources by specifying
            the session name to the constructor of code:ETWTraceEventSource). Sessions are MACHINE WIDE and can
            OUTLIVE the process that creates them. This it takes some care to insure that sessions are cleaned up
            in all cases.
            
            Code that generated ETW events are called Providers. The Kernel has a provider (and it is often the
            most intersting) but other components are free to use public OS APIs (eg WriteEvent), to create
            user-mode providers. Each Provider is given a GUID that is used to identify it. You can get a list of
            all providers on the system as well as their GUIDs by typing the command
            
                        logman query providers
                        
            The basic model is that you start a session (which creates a ETL moduleFile), and then you call
            code:TraceEventSession.EnableProvider on it to add all the providers (event sources), that you are
            interested in. A session is given a name (which is MACHINE WIDE), so that you can connect back up to
            it from another process (since it might outlive the process that created it), so you can modify it or
            (more commonly) close the session down later from another process.
            
            For implementation reasons, this is only one Kernel provider and it can only be specified in a
            special 'Kernel Mode' session. There can be only one kernel mode session (MACHINE WIDE) and it is
            distinguished by a special name 'NT Kernel Logger'. The framework allows you to pass flags to the
            provider to control it and the Kernel provider uses these bits to indicate which particular events
            are of interest. Because of these restrictions, you often need two sessions, one for the kernel
            events and one for all user-mode events.
            
            Sample use. Enabling the Kernel's DLL image logging to the moduleFile output.etl
            
             * TraceEventSession session = new TraceEventSession(, KernelTraceEventParser.Keywords.ImageLoad); 
             * Run you scenario 
             * session.Close(); 
            
            Once the scenario is complete, you use the code:TraceEventSession.Close methodIndex to shut down a
            session. You can also use the code:TraceEventSession.GetActiveSessionNames to get a list of all
            currently running session on the machine (in case you forgot to close them!).
            
            When the sesion is closed, you can use the code:ETWTraceEventSource to parse the events in the ETL
            moduleFile.  Alternatively, you can use code:TraceLog.CreateFromETL to convert the ETL file into an ETLX file. 
            Once it is an ETLX file you have a much richer set of processing options availabe from code:TraceLog.

            or the bottom of the stack), and thus is useful for views where you wish to do this.  The
            disadvantage of this is that you do need to compute all symbolic information before you

            #Introduction
            
            While the raw ETW events are valuable, they really need additional processing to be really useful.
            Things like symbolic names for addresses, the ability to randomly access events, and having various
            links between threads, threads, modules, and eventToStack traces are really needed. This is what
            code:TraceLog provides.
            
            In addition the format of an ETL file is private (it can only be accessed through OS APIs), and the
            only access is as stream of records. This makes it very difficult to do processing on the data
            without reading all the data into memory or reading over the file more than once. Because the data is
            very large, this is quite undesireable. There is also no good place to put digested information like
            symbols, or indexes. code:TraceLog also defines a new file format for trace data, that is public and
            seekable, extendable, and versionable. This is a key piece of added value.
            
            code:TraceLog is really the entry point for a true object model for event data that are cross linked
            to each other as well as the raw events. Here are some of the players
            
            * code:TraceLog - represents the event log as a whole. It holds 'global' things, like a list of
                code:TraceProcesss, and the list of code:TraceModuleFiles
                * code:TraceProcesses - represents a list of code:TraceProcess s, that can be looked up by
                    (PID,time)
                * code:TraceProcess - represents a single process.
                * code:TraceThread - reprsents a thread within a process.
                * code:TraceLoadedModules - represents a list of code:TraceLoadedModule s that can be looked up
                    by (address, time) or (filename, time)
                * code:TraceLoadedModule - represents a loaded DLL or EXE (it knows its image base, and time
                    loaded)
                * code:TraceModuleFile - represents a DLL or EXE on the disk (it only contains information that
                    is common to all threads that use it (eg its name). In particular it holds all the symbolic
                    address to name mappings (extracted from PDBs).  New TraceModuleFiles are generated if a
                    files is loaded in another locations (either later in the same process or a different
                    process).   Thus the image base becomes a attribute of the ModuleFile
                * code:TraceCallStack - represents a call stack associated with the event (on VISTA). It is
                    logically a list of code addresses (from callee to caller).    
                * code:TraceCodeAddress - represents instruction pointer into the code. This can be decorated
                    with symbolic information, (methodIndex, source line, source file) information.
                * code:TraceMethod - represents a particular method.  This class allows information that is
                    common to many samples (it method name and source file), to be shared.  
                
            * See also code:TraceLog.CopyRawEvents for the routine that scans over the events during TraceLog
                creation.
            * See also code:#ProcessHandlersCalledFromTraceLog for callbacks made from code:TraceLog.CopyRawEvents

        <member name="T:FastSerialization.IFastSerializableVersion">
            <summary>
            Objects implement code:IFastSerializableVersion to indicate what the current version is for writing
            and which readers can read the curent version.   If this interface is not implemented a default is
            provided (assuming version 1 for writing and MinimumVersion = 0).  
            
            By default code:Serializer.WriteObject will place marks when the object ends and always skip to the
            end even if the FromStream did not read all the object data.   This allows considerable versioning
            flexibilty.  Simply by placing the new data at the end of the existing serialization, new versions
            of the type can be read by OLD deserializers (new fields will have the value determined by the
            default constructor (typically 0 or null).  This makes is relatively easy to keep MinimumVersion = 0
            (the ideal case).

        <member name="P:FastSerialization.IFastSerializableVersion.Version">
            <summary>
            This is the version number for the serialization format.  It should be incremented whenever a
            changes is made to code:IFastSerializable.ToStream and the format is publicly diseminated.  It
            must not vary from instance to instance.  This is pretty straightforward.  
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:FastSerialization.IFastSerializableVersion.MinimumVersionCanRead">
             <summary>
             At some point typically you give up allowing new versions of the read to read old wire formats
             This is the Minimum version of the serialized data that this reader can deserialize.   Trying
             to read wire formats strictly smaller (older) than this will fail.   Setting this to the current
             version indicates that you don't care about ever reading data generated with an older version
             of the code.  
             
             If you set this to something other than your current version, you are obligated to insure that
             your FromStream() method can handle all formats >= than this number. 
            
             You can achive this if you simply use the 'WriteTagged' and 'ReadTagged' APIs in your 'ToStream' 
             and 'FromStream' after your V1 AND you always add new fields to the end of your class.   
             This is the best practice.   Thus  
             
                 void IFastSerializable.ToStream(Serializer serializer)
                 {
                     serializer.Write(Ver_1_Field1);
                     serializer.Write(Ver_1_Field2);
                     // ...
                     serializer.WriteTagged(Ver_2_Field1);   
                     serializer.WriteTagged(Ver_2_Field2);
                     // ...
                     serializer.WriteTagged(Ver_3_Field1);
                 }
             
                 void IFastSerializable.FromStream(Deserializer deserializer)
                 {
                     deserializer.Read(out Ver_1_Field1);
                     deserializer.Read(out Ver_1_Field2);
                     // ...
                     deserializer.ReadTagged(ref Ver_2_Field1);  // If data no present (old format) then Ver_2_Field1 not set.
                     deserializer.ReadTagged(ref Ver_2_Field2);  // ditto...
                     // ...
                     deserializer.ReadTagged(ref Ver_3_Field1);    
                 } 
             
             Tagging outputs a byte tag in addition to the field itself.   If that is a problem you can also use the
             VersionBeingRead to find out what format is being read and write code that explicitly handles it.  
             Note however that this only gets you Backward compatibility (new readers can read the old format, but old readers 
             will still not be able to read the new format), which is why this is not the preferred method.  
             
                 void IFastSerializable.FromStream(Deserializer deserializer)
                 {
                     // We assme that MinVersionCanRead == 4
                     // Deserialize things that are common to all versions (4 and earlier)

            the current version.  
            
            If you set this to something besides the current version you are obligated to insure that your
            ToStream() method ONLY adds fields at the end, AND that all of those added fields use the WriteTagged()
            operations (which tags the data in a way that old readers can skip even if they don't know what it is)
            In addition your FromStream() method must read these with the ReadTagged() deserializer APIs.  
            
            See the comment in front of MinimumVersionCanRead for an example of using the WriteTagged() and ReadTagged() 
            methods.

            Code ranges need to be looked up by arbitrary address. There are two basic ways of doing this
            efficiently. First a binary search, second create 'buckets' (fixed sized ranges, see
            code:bucketSize and code:RoundToBucket) and round any address to these buckets and look them up
            in a hash table. This latter option is what we use. What this means is that when a entry is added
            to the table (see code:AddMethod) it must be added to every bucket over its range. Each entry in
            the table is a code:CodeAddressBucketEntry which is simply a linked list.

            #SerializerIntroduction see also code:#StreamLayout
            
            The code:Serializer class is a general purpose object graph serializer helper. While it does not have
            any knowledge of the serialization format of individual object, it does impose conventions on how to
            serialize support information like the header (which holds verisioning information), a trailer (which
            holds defered pointer information), and how types are versioned. However these conventions are
            intended to be very generic and thus this class can be used for essentially any serialization need.
            
            Goals:
                * Allows full range of serialization, including subclassing and cyclic object graphs.
                * Can be serialized and deserialized efficiently sequentially (no seeks MANDATED on read or
                    write). This allows the serializer to be used over pipes and other non-seekable devices).
                * Pay for play (thus very efficient in simple cases (no subclassing or cyclic graphs).
                * Ideally self-describing, and debuggable (output as XML if desired?)
            
            Versioning:
                * We want the ability for new formats to accept old versions if objects wish to support old
                    formats
                * Also wish to allow new formats to be read by OLD version if the new format is just an
                    'extension' (data added to end of objects). This makes making new versions almost pain-free.
                    
            Concepts:
                * No-seek requirement
                
                    The serialized form should be such that it can be deseralized efficiently in a serial fasion
                    (no seeks). This means all information needed to deserialize has to be 'just in time' (can't
                    be some table at the end). Pragmatically this means that type information (needed to create
                    instances), has to be output on first use, so it is available for the deserializer.
                    
                * Laziness requirement
                
                    While is should be possible to read the serialized for sequentially, we should also not force
                    it. It should be possible to have a large file that represents a persisted stucture that can
                    be lazily brought into memory on demand. This means that all information needed to
                    deserialize must also be 'randomly available' and not depend on reading from the begining.
                    Pragmatically this means that type information, and forward forwardReference information needs to
                    have a table in a well known Location at the end so that it can be found without having to
                    search the file sequentially.
                
                * Versioning requirement
                    
                    To allow OLD code to access NEW formats, it must be the case that the serialized form of
                    every instance knows how to 'skip' past any new data (even if it does not know its exact
                    size). To support this, objects have 'begin' and 'end' tags, which allows the deserializer to
                    skip the next object.
                    
                * Polymorphsim requirement
                
                    Because the user of a filed may not know the exact instance stored there, in general objects
                    need to store the exact type of the instance. Thus they need to store a type identifer, this
                    can be folded into the 'begin' tag.
                    
                * Arbitrary object graph (cicularity) requirement (Forward references)
                
                    The serializer needs to be able to serialize arbirary object graphs, including those with
                    cycles in them. While you can do this without forward references, the system is more flexible
                    if it has the concept of a forward refernce. Thus whenever a object refernece is required, a
                    'forward forwardReference' can be given instead. What gets serialized is simply an unique forward
                    refernece index (index into an array), and at some later time that index is given its true
                    value. This can either happen with the target object is serialied (see
                    code:Serializer.Tags.ForwardDefintion) or at the end of the serialization in a forward
                    refernece table (which allows forward references to be resolved without scanning then entire
                    file.
                    
                * Contract between objects code:IFastSerializable.ToStream:
                
                    The heart of the serialization and deserialization process s the code:IFastSerializable
                    interface, which implements just two methods: ToStream (for serializing an object), and
                    FromStream (for deserializing and object). This intefaces is the mechanism by which objects
                    tell the serializer what data to store for an individual instance. However this core is not
                    enough. An object that implements code:IFastSerializable must also implement a default
                    constructor (constructor with no args), so that that deserializer can create the object (and
                    then call FromStream to populated it).
                    
                    The ToStream methodIndex is only responsible for serializing the data in the object, and by itself
                    is not sufficient to serialize an interconnected, polymoriphic graph of objects. It needs
                    help from the code:Serializer and code:Deserialize to do this. code:Serializer takes on the
                    responsibility to deal with persisting type information (so that code:Deserialize can create
                    the correct type before code:IFastSerializable.FromStream is called). It is also the
                    serializer's responsibilty to provide the mechanism for dealing with circular object graphs
                    and forward references.
                
                * Layout of a serialized object: A serialized object has the following basic format
                
                    * If the object is the defintion of a previous forward references, then the defintion must
                        begin with a code:Serializer.Tags.ForwardDefintion tag followed by a forward forwardReference
                        index which is being defined.
                    * code:Serializer.Tags.BeginObject tag
                    * A reference to the code:SerializationType for the object. This refernece CANNOT be a
                        forward forwardReference because its value is needed during the deserialization process before
                        forward references are resolved.
                    * All the data that that objects 'code:IFastSerializable.ToStream methodIndex wrote. This is the
                        heart of the deserialized data, and the object itself has a lot of control over this
                        format.
                    * code:Serializer.Tags.EndObject tag. This marks the end of the object. It quickly finds bugs
                        in ToStream FromStream mismatches, and also allows for V1 deserializers to skip past
                        additional fields added since V1.
                    
                * Serializing Object references:
                  When an object forwardReference is serialized, any of the following may follow in the stream
                  
                    * code:Serializer.Tags.NullReference used to encode a null object forwardReference.
                    * code:Serializer.Tags.BeginObject or code:Serializer.Tags.ForwardDefintion, which indicates
                        that this the first time the target object has been referenced, and the target is being
                        serialized on the spot.
                    * code:Serializer.Tags.ObjectReference which indicates that the target object has already
                        been serialized and what follows is the StreamLabel of where the definition is.
                    * code:Serializer.Tags.ForwardReference followed by a new forward forwardReference index. This
                        indicates that the object is not yet serialized, but the serializer has choosen not to
                        immediately serialize the object. Ultimately this object will be defined, but has not
                        happened yet.
                       
                * Serializing Types:
                  Types are simply objects of type code:SerializationType which contain enough information about
                  the type for the Deserializer to do its work (it full name and version number).   They are
                  serialized just like all other types.  The only thing special about it is that references to
                  types after the BeginObject tag must not be forward references.  
             
            #StreamLayout:

            To tune working set (or disk seeks), or to make the dump of the format more readable, it is

            be serialized (by default the first encountered does it).

            somewhere later in the serialization process the object will be serialized. If no call to
            WriteObject() occurs, then the object is serialized automatically before the stream is closed

            #DeferedRegionOverview. 
            
            A DeferedRegion help make 'lazy' objects. You will have a DeferedRegion for each block of object you
            wish to independently decide whether to deserialize lazily (typically you have on per object however
            in the limit you can have one per field, it is up to you).
            
            When you call code:DeferedRegion.Write you give it a delegate that will write all the defered fields.
            The Write operation will place a forward reference in the stream that skips all the fields written,
            then the fields themselves, then define the forward reference. This allows readers to skip the
            defered fields.
            
            When you call code:DeferedRegion.Read  you also give it a delegate that reads all the defered fields.
            However when 'Read' instead of reading the fields it
            
                * remembers the deseializer, stream position, and reading delegate.
                * it uses the forward refernece to skip the region.
                
            When code:DeferedRegion.FinishRead is called, it first checks if the region was already restored. 
            If not it used the information to read in the defered region and returns.  Thus this FinishRead
            should be called before any deferred field is used.

            A HistoryDictionary is designed to look up 'handles' (pointer sized quantities), that might get reused
            over time (eg Process IDs, thread IDs).  Thus it takes a handle AND A TIME, and finds the value
            associated with that handle at that time.

            This parser knows how to decode Windows Software Trace Preprocessor (WPP) events.  In order to decode
            the events it needs access to the TMF files that describe the events (these are created from the PDB at 
            build time. 
            
            Mostly what you use this for is the 'FormattedMessage' property of the event.
