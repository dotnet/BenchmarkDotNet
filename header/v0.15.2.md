## Highlights

- The most significant update in this release is the enhanced accuracy of the memory diagnoser ([#2562](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2562)). This improvement resolves the issue of incorrectly reported memory allocations ([#1542](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1542), [#2582](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2582)).
- We have introduced a new feature that allows users to sort benchmark jobs in numerical order ([#2768](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2768), [#2770](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2770)).
- Benchmark validation has been improved ([#2771](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2771)).
- An issue with non-persistent auto-generated JobId has been fixed ([#2777](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/2777)).
