# Contributions are welcome!

BenchmarkDotNet is already a stable full-featured library which allows performing performance investigation on a professional level.
And it continues to evolve!
We add new features all the time, but we have too many new cool ideas.
Any help will be appreciated.
You can develop new features, fix bugs, improve the documentation, or do some other cool stuff.

If you want to contribute, check out the
  [Contributing guide](http://benchmarkdotnet.org/Contributing.htm) and
  [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:up-for-grabs) issues.
If you have new ideas or want to complain about bugs, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/new).
Let's build the best tool for benchmarking together!
